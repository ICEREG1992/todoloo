# todoloo
Simple React app for creating and managing To-dos. Todoloo is focused on UX first and foremost-- everything you see is functional, and does what you expect it to. For example, leaving a todo blank after you first add it keeps the todo blank so you can fill it in later, but pressing changing the text of a todo to blank then pressing enter removes that todo from the list. Rewards for checking off todos are minimal yet satisfying: a small green bar at the bottom of your screen tracks your progress out of the current todos, and a small emoji on the empty list message is a cute reward for finishing your work.
